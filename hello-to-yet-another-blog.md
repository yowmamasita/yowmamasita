# Hello to yet another blog

After I realized that some people are using GH gist to publish ad hoc posts, I immediately jumped on the idea and executed on making yet another blog. This time, it's freeloading not just on GitHub's hosting capabilities. We are also using the commenting system with GitHub identities and many other features. I think it's quite a good setup, and you only need 2 things to start.

1. GitHub cli - I've only recently known this but this is quite a powerful utility.
2. [A Profile Readme](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile-managing-your-profile-readme)

Actually, there's a third part and that's the wrapper script. This [blog script](./blog.plugin.zsh) is only compatible with zsh (and maybe just macOS) right now.
